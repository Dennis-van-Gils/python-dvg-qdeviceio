DvG_QDeviceIO
=============
*Hassle-free PyQt/PySide interface for multithreaded data acquisition and communication with an I/O device.*

It will manage many necessary components for proper multithreading -- creation
and handling of the threads, workers, signals and mutexes -- *for you*, reducing
it to just a few simple method calls of a QDeviceIO class instance to get set up
and going.

Supports PyQt5, PyQt6, PySide2 and PySide6.
