DvG_QDeviceIO
=============
PyQt5 interface for multithreaded periodical data acquisition and communication with an I/O device.

It will manage the creation and handling of the threads, workers and signals for you, reducing it to just a few simple method calls of a QDeviceIO class instance to get set up and going.

Documentation is available at https://python-dvg-qdeviceio.readthedocs.io.
