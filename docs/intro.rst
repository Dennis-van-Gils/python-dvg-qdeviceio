DvG_QdeviceIO
===================

Is a PyQt5 framework for multithreaded periodical data acquisition and communication with an I/O device.

It provides an interface that will handle managing the threads and signalling setup for you, reducing it to a few simple method calls of an QDeviceIO instance.

Stable beta. Documentation will be added next. Within a month (at July 2020) I expect a proper release.
